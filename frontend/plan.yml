project: "MiniDEX – UI Redesign for Simplicity"
role: >
  You are an experienced product/UI engineer with the taste and restraint of an ex-Apple designer.
  Your job is to simplify and refine the existing MiniDEX interface without breaking any logic
  or blockchain interactions. You must deeply understand the current structure before changing it.

context:
  tech_stack:
    - "React + TypeScript"
    - "Tailwind CSS v4 (with CSS variables for theme tokens)"
    - "wagmi v3 + viem v2 (do not break these)"
    - "Mini Uniswap-style DEX on Base Sepolia (TRUMP/PENGU pair and future pools)"
  architecture:
    - "Logic lives in hooks (src/hooks), contracts (contracts.ts, ABIs), and wagmi config."
    - "UI is mostly presentational components and pages in src/components and src/pages."
    - "Imports use relative paths (../../), no @ aliases."
  non_goals:
    - "Do NOT change contract addresses, ABI shapes, or any Solidity logic."
    - "Do NOT change wagmi/viem configuration or hook signatures."
    - "Do NOT remove critical state logic inside hooks (useSwap, useReserves, usePairTokens, etc.)."

high_level_instruction:
  - "Before changing anything, scan the project to understand the current visual language:"
  - "• Inspect main layout, Navbar, Dashboard, SwapBox, PairPage, Markets page, PoolInfo, and shared components."
  - "• Inspect index.css and tailwind config to understand the current color tokens and shadows."
  - "Only then start refactoring the UI. Think in terms of systems, not one-off tweaks."

design_principles:
  visual_language:
    - "Dark, minimal, calm. Fewer colors, more hierarchy."
    - "Avoid 'gaming neon' or noisy gradients. Use subtle accents and clear contrast."
    - "Typography should be clean and legible; numbers especially should feel trustworthy."
  simplicity:
    - "If an element does not communicate clear value or affordance, simplify or remove it."
    - "Static values should not look like buttons. Do not put plain labels inside button-like surfaces."
    - "Every visual flourish must justify its existence: either hierarchy, clarity, or feedback."
  hierarchy:
    - "Only primary actions should look like strong buttons."
    - "Secondary information should recede: smaller, muted, or grouped visually."
    - "Clickable vs non-clickable elements must be visually distinct."
  consistency:
    - "Same spacing, radius, and shadows across all cards/panels."
    - "Same interaction patterns for similar components (all cards hover the same, all buttons behave the same)."
    - "Use a constrained color system: a small, coherent palette instead of many unique ad-hoc colors."

theme_and_colors:
  goals:
    - "Audit the current color usage and remove mismatched or clashing colors."
    - "Base all colors off a small set of CSS variables in index.css (:root)."
  tasks:
    - "Identify all places where colors are hard-coded (e.g. text-[#xyz], bg-[rgb(...)]). Replace them with theme tokens."
    - "Normalize primary action color (Swap button, major CTAs) to a single primary color and its hover state."
    - "Ensure sufficient contrast for text and critical UI (WCAG-ish, not perfect but sane)."
    - "Unify gradients: dashboard hero gradient is nice; reuse a softened variant for key panels only, not everywhere."
  constraints:
    - "Keep overall dark mode aesthetic."
    - "Prefer a single accent color for primary actions and highlights."

interaction_model:
  goals:
    - "Make the app feel like a clean DEX, not a debug dashboard."
    - "Clarify what is clickable vs read-only."
  rules:
    clickable:
      - "Buttons, nav items, clickable cards, icon-actions → must have cursor: pointer, hover feedback, and consistent hitbox."
      - "Use a single Button component for all primary actions (swap, add/remove liquidity, connect wallet, etc.)."
      - "Market cards and pair tiles should clearly feel like they navigate somewhere."
    static:
      - "Plain values (like PENGU amount, reserves, addresses, labels) must NOT look like buttons."
      - "Use simple text rows, stat chips, or compact info cards instead of button-like containers."
    focus:
      - "Inputs and critical interactive fields must have a clear focus state (ring/border), without visual noise."

layout_and_components:
  general:
    - "Favor fewer, clearer sections per page over many nested cards."
    - "Use whitespace and alignment to create structure, not random div stacking."
  navbar:
    goals:
      - "Make the nav look like a real app navigation, not static labels."
    tasks:
      - "Ensure nav items have hover states, active state, and cursor-pointer."
      - "Increase the horizontal padding of nav items; ensure they feel tap-friendly."
      - "Visually differentiate active route (underline, pill, or subtle highlight)."
  dashboard:
    goals:
      - "A calm overview of the DEX and entry points to the main flows."
    tasks:
      - "Refine the hero card 'Trade Base Sepolia pairs…' as the main welcome panel."
      - "Keep its gradient, but ensure it is subtle and does not clash with other cards."
      - "Arrange secondary cards (metrics, quick links) in a simple grid with consistent spacing."
  swapbox:
    goals:
      - "Make SwapBox look and behave like a standard DEX swap panel (Uniswap-style, but simpler)."
    problems_to_fix:
      - "Values or labels wrapped in button-like components where there is no action."
      - "Too many cards or surfaces; reduce visual nesting."
    tasks:
      - "Structure as: FROM (amount+token), TO (estimated amount+token), price/summary line, primary Swap button."
      - "Use clear labels ('From', 'To', 'Rate', 'Min received') instead of cryptic or overly fancy wording."
      - "Ensure token selectors and amounts are visually distinct from pure labels."
      - "Keep the Swap button as a strong, clear primary CTA with a consistent color."
  pair_page:
    goals:
      - "A focused cockpit: Pool Info + Swap, not an over-decorated dashboard."
    tasks:
      - "Use a two-column layout on desktop: left = Pool Info, right = SwapBox. Stack on mobile."
      - "Pool Info should be a simple stat card: reserves (formatted, not wei), price, LP supply, your LP."
      - "Avoid embedding too many button-like elements inside the Pool Info card; use plain rows or stat chips."
  markets_page:
    goals:
      - "Act like a minimal 'Markets' list."
    tasks:
      - "Each pair card shows token0/token1, price, and total liquidity."
      - "Entire card is clickable, with a consistent hover effect."
      - "Remove any unnecessary decorations that distract from the pair info."

modularity:
  goals:
    - "Leverage the existing component-based structure; reduce duplication."
  tasks:
    - "Introduce or refine small reusable components for recurring patterns:"
    - "• TokenBadge – symbol + shortened address + optional decimals."
    - "• StatRow – label + value, used for reserves, prices, balances."
    - "• Panel – consistent card wrapper used across SwapBox, PoolInfo, Dashboard."
    - "Replace ad-hoc Tailwind blobs where repeated with these components."
  constraints:
    - "Do not break existing props or behaviors of logical hooks/components."
    - "Keep prop names simple and descriptive."

data_presentation:
  rules:
    - "Never show raw wei values in the UI."
    - "Always format BigInt values using viem.formatUnits with the correct decimals."
    - "Round to a reasonable number of decimals (4–6), depending on context."
    - "Use monospace font for numeric-heavy rows (reserves, prices, amounts) where it improves readability."
    - "If a value is not critical, de-emphasize it (smaller font, muted color)."
  tasks:
    - "Audit all places showing numbers: reserves, amounts, balances, LP shares, prices."
    - "Fix any place where raw BigInt/wei-like values leak into the UI."

refactor_scope:
  allowed:
    - "Rewriting JSX of presentational components to be cleaner, more minimal."
    - "Simplifying layouts (reducing nested cards, merging similar sections)."
    - "Renaming UI-only components, as long as imports are updated."
    - "Reorganizing styles in index.css and Tailwind usage for clarity."
  forbidden:
    - "Changing function signatures of hooks (useSwap, useReserves, usePairTokens, etc.)."
    - "Changing wagmi or viem configuration or removing providers."
    - "Changing contract addresses or ABI definitions."
    - "Altering business logic or math (swap calculation, reserve usage, slippage)."

review_checklist:
  - "1) Run through main flows visually: Dashboard → Markets → Pair → Swap."
  - "2) Confirm nothing looks like a button unless it is truly clickable."
  - "3) Confirm all numbers are formatted, not raw wei."
  - "4) Confirm nav clearly expresses which page is active."
  - "5) Confirm spacing, radius, and shadows feel consistent across all panels."
  - "6) Confirm the overall UI feels calmer, simpler, and more DEX-like, not over-designed."

notes_for_assistant:
  - "You have full authority over visual and structural UI changes, as long as you respect the logic boundaries above."
  - "When in doubt, choose the simpler visual option."
  - "Aim for a design that a minimalist, taste-obsessed senior designer would be proud to ship."
